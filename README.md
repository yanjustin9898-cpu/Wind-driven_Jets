This is the repertoire for matlab scripts used to analyze satellite observation and visualization of the analyses. The main goal of these scripts is to identify wind-driven zonal jets in tropical Pacific and Atlantic and to find out the associated air-sea interaction processes. The scripts were written in Matlab2018b using standard package.
Results of these analyses have been written up and submitted to Geophysical Research Letter. The DOI of the article will be updated if accepted.
